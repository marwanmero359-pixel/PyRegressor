1.how do i  load two different data sets (portugues and math subjects) containing same features together ? 

2.
finalscore = data['G3']
data = data.drop(columns = ['G3'])
from sklearn.preprocessing import (
MinMaxScaler,
StandardScaler,
)
standard_scaler = StandardScaler().set_output(transform="pandas")
data_standardized = standard_scaler.fit_transform(data)
minmax_scaler = MinMaxScaler().set_output(transform="pandas")
data_normalized = minmax_scaler.fit_transform(data)

NameError: name 'data' is not defined 

i loaded data but its this code isnt working . help me fix it . 


3.how do i correctly read the results of this image ? (correlationmatrix.png) 

4.whats the difference between confustion matrix and corelation matrix ? 

5.how do i describe grid search and cross validation in a report?

6.whats the difference between r^2 and rmse in regression ?

7.my MLP regressor is taking more than 15 mins is that normal ? (pic of mlp code was attached ) 

8.how do i know if  those results are correct ? (pic of mlp r^2 and rmse scores) 

9.can you rewrite my methodology section in a more academic tone (mlp.py and linerregressor.py were attached) 

10.why is my MLP not improving after increasing max_iter? 

11.is standarisation needed for my linear regressor ? 

12. help me write readme.md for this respo . (photo of main branch attached )
